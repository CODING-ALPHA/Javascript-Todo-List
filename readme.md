# Javascript Todo List

- This is a simple to-do list application built with HTML, CSS, SASS and Js that allows you to manage your tasks and keep track of things you need to get done. It uses local storage to persist your data, so your lists are saved even when you refresh the page or close your browser.

## How to use it

- Add a task: Enter your desired task in the input field and click the "Add" button.
- Delete a task: You can't directly delete tasks in this basic version. However, you can clear your entire list by refreshing the page (your saved data will be lost).

## Features:

- Local storage persistence (tasks are saved even after page refresh).

### Note:

This is a basic to-do list app. More advanced features like editing tasks can be added later.

## Security:

- This app does not collect or store any personal information.
- Local storage data is accessible only within your browser and is not shared with any external servers.

### Features to be added later:

- Implement edit and delete functionality for individual tasks.
- Add the ability to prioritize tasks.
- Allow users to categorize tasks.
- Explore using a persistent storage mechanism like a server-side database for more robust data persistence.

### Feel free to:

- Customize the appearance of the app using CSS.
- Add new features based on your needs.
